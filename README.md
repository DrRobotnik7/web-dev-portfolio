# Jack Johnson's Web Development Portfolio

## Description

A portfolio built using React that showcases my web development skills and projects. This is a single page application that utilises React Router to dynamically render content instead of redirecting to a new URL and loading the entire page. This makes the website much faster to navigate.

## Credits

I would like to acknowledge my peers in Sibert-pod-11. We're all on the same learning journey and have helped each other massively during the front-end web development skills boot camp.

I might need to acknowledge myself, as I used code from prior portfolio projects.

I used React Bootstrap components found on this website: https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app

Finally I used https://getform.io/ to generate my form endpoint so I can store and view messages submitted by users on my Contact page.
